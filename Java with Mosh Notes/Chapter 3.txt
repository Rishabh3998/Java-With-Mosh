Java Fundamentals

1. Variables:
- We use variables to temporary store data in computers memory.
- int age = 30; [dataType variableName = value]

2. Various types:
- Primitive (for storing simple values)
  - byte(1) [-128, 127], short(2) [-32K, 32K], int(4) [-2B, 2B], long(8) (For whole numbers)
  - float(4), double(8) (For decimal numbers)
  - char(2) [A, B, C], boolean(1) [true/false]

Note: Suppose you are storing a number which is very large, and you want to format it like the one
that we generally do while writing numbers on documents (1,25,000), In this case we use _ (underscore)

int viewsCount = 123_456_789;

By default Java sees each numerical value as integer so if we write
long viewsCountLong = 3_123_456_789;

Java will still see the number as int and throw error that: `Integer number too large`

To fix this use L in the end of the number:
long viewsCountLong = 3_123_456_789L; // Fix for above issue

Same this goes with decimal numbers, Java sees them as doubles by default so if you use float, error will 
be there.

float price = 10.99; // error

Fix:
float price = 10.99F;
