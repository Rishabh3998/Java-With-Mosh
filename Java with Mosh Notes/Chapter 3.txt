Java Fundamentals

1. Variables:
- We use variables to temporary store data in computers memory.
- int age = 30; [dataType variableName = value]

2. Various types:
- Primitive (for storing simple values [number, characters, booleans])
  - byte(1) [-128, 127], short(2) [-32K, 32K], int(4) [-2B, 2B], long(8) (For whole numbers)
  - float(4), double(8) (For decimal numbers)
  - char(2) [A, B, C], boolean(1) [true/false]

Note: Suppose you are storing a number which is very large, and you want to format it like the one
that we generally do while writing numbers on documents (1,25,000), In this case we use _ (underscore)

int viewsCount = 123_456_789;

By default Java sees each numerical value as integer so if we write
long viewsCountLong = 3_123_456_789;

Java will still see the number as int and throw error that: `Integer number too large`

To fix this use L in the end of the number:
long viewsCountLong = 3_123_456_789L; // Fix for above issue

Same this goes with decimal numbers, Java sees them as doubles by default so if you use float, error will 
be there.

float price = 10.99; // error

Fix:
float price = 10.99F;

Note: We can have same class in different packages, it will not create any conflict
Eg: Date exists in [java.util, java.sql], packages create namespace for our classes.

Note: When we are declaring primitive types we don't need to allocate memory, but while declaring the 
reference types we have to use `new` keyword to allocate memory for the data type which we are going to declare.
Primitive types don't have any members, but Reference types has members.

Eg: byte age = 30; [age.[] = no member we cannot access anything via dot]
Eg: Date now = new Date(); [now.getTime() = getTime is the member]

- Reference (for storing complex objects [data, mail message])
  - while declaring the reference types we have to use `new` keyword to allocate memory for the data type which 
  we are going to declare.
  - Date now = new Date(); [now.getTime() = getTime is the member]
  - In primitive types, values allocated in separate memory and are independent to each other, in reference type
  the behavior is little different.
  - Allocation of point1(1,1) [address: 100]
  - point1[100], here variable store the address of the point object present in memory, not the actual point object.
  - point2[100], same address will be stored here of the Point object.


  point1[value: 100] -
                        - 
                           -> Point(1,1) [address: 100]
                        -
  point2[value: 100] -

- If we change one point variable the change will affect the other variable too, which is pointing to the same 
address.

The above was applicable for older versions of Java, but in new versions, this also becomes independent and 
the other variable will not get affected due to this.
