Constants

To make any variable constant through the program, we use final keyword.
This keyword tells Java that this variable will be only initialized once and cannot be re-assigned, to a new value.
If programmer will try to re-assign this, the IDE will throw compilation error.

Arithmetic Expressions

In Java we have same arithmetic expressions that we have in Mathematics.

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus (Remainder of a division)

**Order of Operations in Arithmetic Operations**

int x = 10 + 3 * 2;

This will use BODMAS kind of rule, here the priority of * and / is more than + and -
-> 10 + 3 * 2;
-> 10 + 6
-> 16

Order => Brackets () >> * and / >> + and -

**Casting and Type conversion**

Casting are of 2 types:
1. Implicit (Automatic)
2. Explicit (Done by user)

Casting can only happen between compatible types, so all these types are compatible because these all are numbers.
We cannot cast a string to become a number. Not compatible.

How to do this casting if types are incompatible.

String x = "1";
Integer.parseInt(x); // Takes string and returns integer
