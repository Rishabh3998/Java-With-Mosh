Mathematics

Let's take a look at the Math class to perform mathematical Operations.

Go through the code to get a better understanding

NumberFormat class for formatting the numbers

We have this class which can help us to format the numbers we have, this works as a utility for us.
We cannot instantiate this in Java, because this class is abstract. In Java we have this concept of abstract classes, 
like some classes are abstract, basically like a half baked cake, we cannot use the new operator to create an
instance of them.

We cannot create an instance of a class if the class is abstract in nature. Eg: NumberFormat class.

This class has a bunch of methods, we can access them using dot operator.
Eg: NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()

When we call these methods, it will create an instance of this NumberFormat class and return it.
So, to create an instance we use these methods instead of using new operator. This is what we call a factory method.
Because it is kind of a factory, which creates new object, the return type would be a NumberFormat object.

Reading inputs

To read the inputs from the user, we can use scanner class.
Syntax: Within the parenthesis define the one from which you are going to read the input, Eg: Terminal, File etc
Scanner sc = new Scanner();
For Terminal we use System.in
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

We can read inputs of multiple type like String, byte, BigDecimal etc. We can access these via .next, .nextByte etc.

Scanner.next();
Scanner.nextByte();
Scanner.nextBigDecimal();
Scanner.nextBoolean();
Scanner.nextFloat();
