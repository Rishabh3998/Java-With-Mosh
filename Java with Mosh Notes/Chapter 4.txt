Strings

Strings are the group of characters stores in a variable. String is a reference type variable.
String str = new String("Hello");
String shortStr = "Hello";

In Java Strings are immutable, we cannot mutate a string.
So, any method that modify the strings always returns a new string object.

Refer the code to see the methods present in String object.
