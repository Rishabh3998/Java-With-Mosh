How Java Code Gets Executed:

There are basically 2 steps involved here:
- Compilation
- execution

            Source code (.java)    =>      Java compiler       =>          Byte Code (.class)

In Compilation step Intellij uses the Java compiler to compile our code into a different format called
Java bytecode. This compiler comes with the JDK.

Now in our IDE to create this bytecode file, just open the file in terminal via right click on the file
and click on the open->terminal. This file will be opened in terminal.

Now write `javac Main.java`, now an out folder will be created with the bytecode file present inside it.

Path: /Users/rishabh/Developer/2. Backend/Java/Java with Mosh/out/production/Java with Mosh/com/codewithmosh/Main.class

The Java bytecode that we have in this file is platform independent, that means it can run on windows, mac, 
linux and on any OS that has a Java runtime environment (JRE).

We can download this JRE from the Oracle website for any OS, this JRE has a software component called 
Java Virtual Machine or JVM this JVM takes our Java Bytecode and translates it to the native code for the 
underlying OS, so if we are on windows OS this JVM will convert it to the compatible native code for windows.

Due to this architecture Java applications are portable or platform independent.

To run our file via terminal use cd ../ etc to get to the correct path then run the command:

Syntax of cmd: java com.(packageName).(className)
- java com.codewithmosh.Main    

The above will run the file and show the output.
