Arrays

We use Arrays to store a list of items, [numbers, characters, string, etc];
To print an array, we use Arrays library. Arrays.toString(numbers);
Note: Multiple implementations of a method is known as method overloading.
Arrays have a predefined fix size, and we can only add the limited amount of elements
according to the defined size, to make this array dynamic i.e. add n number of elements
dynamically we have to use Java Collections library, in which we have one data structure
specifically for this.

Multi-dimensional Arrays

Go through the code, to understand how 2-D, 3-D, etc etc works.
