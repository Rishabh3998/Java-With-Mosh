## Control Flows

1. Comparison Operators ( ==, >=, <=, >, <, != )
2. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
3. Conditional statements (If, else if, else, switch)
4. Loops
5. Error Handling

## For Loops

For loop (classic) syntax:
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body
}

Example:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // use i
}

Notes:
- initialization: runs once before the loop starts (can declare variables here).
- condition: evaluated before each iteration; loop stops when false.
- update: executed after each iteration (commonly increments/decrements).
- All three parts are optional but the semicolons are required:
  for (;; ) { ... } // infinite loop
- Multiple variables: for (int i = 0, j = n; i < j; i++, j--) { ... }
- Scope: variables declared in the header are scoped to the loop.
- Use break to exit early, continue to skip to the next iteration.
- Use classic for when you need an index, custom step size, or to iterate a range.

Enhanced for (for-each) syntax:
for (ElementType elem : collectionOrArray) {
    // use elem
}

Examples:
for (String s : list) {
    System.out.println(s);
}
for (int x : array) {
    // use x
}

Notes:
- Works with arrays and any Iterable (e.g., List, Set).
- Simpler and less error-prone for straightforward iteration.
- No index access directly; if you need the index, use the classic for.
- Modifying the collection structurally during iteration may throw ConcurrentModificationException.
- The loop variable holds a copy for primitives or a reference for objects; modifying the reference won't replace elements in the array/collection.
- Use for-each for readability when you only need each element.
