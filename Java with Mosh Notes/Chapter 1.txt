Introduction to Java:

Installing JAVA: 
- To create Java Applications you need JDK (Java Development Kit)
- It is a software development environment for building Java applications, It has a compiler, it has a bunch of code that we can reuse, it had a java runtime environment, etc.

Java SE = Java Standard Addition 

In this Java tutorial, we're gonna look at the anatomy of Java programs, the smallest building
blocks in Java programs are `Functions`.

A Function is a block of code that performs a task.

ReturnType Name() {
    set of steps to perform some task
}

Eg: void type function which does not return anything 
void sendEmail() {

}

Entry point of the execution of a program is via main function
void main() {

}

These functions don't exist on their own, they should always belong to a class, so a class is a 
container for one or more related functions. Basically we use these classes to organize our code.

Eg: 
class Main {
    void main() {
        ....
        ....
    }
}

Functions defined between {} of a class belongs to this class, and we refer to them as methods, so
a method is a function that is part of a class. In some languages we can create functions outside a class,
which we refer as functions. 

But as Java is a pure Object oriented language we create the functions inside a class and call them
methods. 

In Java all these classes and methods should have an access modifier, an access modifier is a special keyword
that determines if other classes and methods in this program can access these classes and methods.

We have various access modifiers like:
1. public
2. private 
....
...

Most of the time we generally use public access modifier.

Eg:
public class Main {
    public void main() {

    }
}

The above example is the basic structure of a Java program, at a minimum we will have a main class and inside
this main class we have the main method.

Now why we have M in Main class and m in main method.

In Java we use different conventions for naming our classes and our methods.

To name our classes we use "PascalNamingConvention".
To name our methods we use "camelNamingConvention".

As we have classes which helps us to organize our code, by the same token we have a concept called `package` and we use 
a package to group related classes, so as our applications grow we're gonna end up with hundreds or even thousands of 
classes so we should properly organize this classes into packages.

Now by convention the base package for Java Project is the domain name of your company in reverse, so the website name
is codewithrishabh.com i.e. why we are gonna set the base package as com.codewithrishabh

Note: Main method in our project should always be `static`. we will talk about static later.

Eg:
package com.codewithmosh;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your code here
        // System is a class in which some members are defined which can be
        // used via dot operator
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
